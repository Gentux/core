Session management
==================

Session token
-------------

Associated to email+ip+mac

Prevent brute force guess
-------------------------

* Lock account for IP address that failed to login after N attempts.

* Store cookie client side to mark it as suspect and refuse connection until a time interval has elapsed. (WEAK ?)

* Only allow connections from a set of known IP addresses

* use captcha ?

* Only allow connections from a set of known IP addresses


Workflow
--------

js.Login(credentials)

Failure
-------
  => Wrong credential
  => Already connected
  => Account locked

Success
-------
  => session_token

Session store
-------------

Map userEmail <> password
Map userEmail <> token


Desirable
---------

Which in-house authentication service may be of interest to integrate in our session management

Auth with third party services such as : Google ID, Twitter ?
=> Not very commonplace in IT world
